I'm a senior engineer with an emphasis in distributed systems and
architecture. I've lead teams, built novel systems, and been a
production engineer for 15 years. I have a strong background in lower
level unix and networking, and experience with a wide variety of
databases and programming languages and paradigms.


Hi! I'm Lang Martin, and I live in Chattanooga, TN which is right at
the end of the Appalachians and super beautiful in April. I like
backend code and distributed systems, and sometimes think about
interfaces too. Here's a mixed bag of things I like:

1. Lisp (esp. Clojure and scheme)
2. Motorcycles
3. Conflict-free replicated data types
4. Hanging out on Porches
5. Linguistics (more enthusiasm than expertise)

Also, on pins and needles for http://sigbovik.org/2019/ which is
streaming live this year! https://www.twitch.tv/sigbovik
