Lang is a distributed systems engineer at Subspace, where he counts
milliseconds and lists facts about networks. He's currently also a
school teacher, so recent skill acquisitions include Elixir and
remembering long division.

This paper describes MOLLY, a system for automatically exploring the
state space of fault toleration bugs and deriving partial formal
models from production systems.

** Stonebraker's Salty

Lang is a Senior Engineer at Hashicorp where he orchestrates
containers and sometimes tries to float rafts. Reluctant gopher,
seasoned schemer, distributed systems dweeb.

This paper provides a summary of 35 years of data model proposals,
grouped into 9 different eras. We discuss the proposals of each era,
and show that there are only a few basic data modeling ideas, and most
have been around a long time. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to
summarize 35 years worth of “progress” and point out what should be
learned from this lengthy exercise.

I'm a senior engineer with an emphasis in distributed systems and
architecture. I've lead teams, built novel systems, and been a
production engineer for 15 years. I have a strong background in lower
level unix and networking, and experience with a wide variety of
databases and programming languages and paradigms.

Hi! I'm Lang Martin, and I live in Chattanooga, TN which is right at
the end of the Appalachians and super beautiful in April. I like
backend code and distributed systems, and sometimes think about
interfaces too. Here's a mixed bag of things I like:

1. Lisp (esp. Clojure and scheme)
2. Motorcycles
3. Conflict-free replicated data types
4. Hanging out on Porches
5. Linguistics (more enthusiasm than expertise)
