*** Butternut Squash Hummus-like

http://www.twoofakindcooks.com/butternut-squash-and-tahini-dip/

1 small butternut squash (about 1 pound), halved lengthwise and seeds removed
3 garlic cloves, unpeeled
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more for finish
1 teaspoon ground cumin
3 shallots, minced
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
3 tablespoons tahini
1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper, plus more for finish
toasted sesame seeds (optional, for garnish)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil. Brush cut
sides of butternut squash and outside of garlic cloves with 1
tablespoon olive oil. Arrange squash, cut side down, and garlic cloves
on the baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes or until fork tender.
Remove from the oven. When the squash is cool enough to handle, scoop
out flesh and transfer to a medium bowl.

While the squash and garlic are roasting, heat remaining 2 tablespoons
olive oil in a small fry pan over medium heat. Add cumin and cook,
stirring often, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add shallots and salt
and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 6 minutes.
Let cool slightly and then transfer to a food processor.

Squeeze out roasted garlic and add to the food processor. Add 1⅓ cups
prepared squash, tahini and Aleppo pepper and process until smooth.
Add 1-2 tablespoons of water to thin out the dip, if desired.
